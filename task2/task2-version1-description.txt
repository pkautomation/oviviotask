# Performance tests summary

Target API: endpoint https://reqres.in/api/users?page=1
Test duration: 5 minutes
Connection: 1Gbps

Response time:
P50:14.13 ms
P95:20.19 ms
P99:27.48 ms

Throughput (requests/sec): avg 99.7, max 111
Error rate: 0

# Interpretation

What happened is: the API was able to handle 100 responses per second
for 10 seconds. After that API was responding with non 200 status code 
for about 1 minute. This pattern continued along the run.

What could be the root cause: 
Option 1: too many requests done by single api token
- api can have limitation for particular user 
and block him for a while from time to time
Option 2: intentional traffic limitation
- There might be configuration set to reject the requests 
after certain amount of requests being done in particular period of time
